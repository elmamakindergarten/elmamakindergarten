# ElMaMa dining hall almost finished

The flooring for our new kitchen in the dining hall, as well as the doors and exterior are almost completed now. The dining hall will be an important gathering place for our children and parents and support the Watamu community.

Already at our previous visit to the kindergarten in 2024, works have begun to install the new oven and other kitchen supplies to enable more efficient and sanitary preparation of the school meals by our chef [Mary](/team/).
