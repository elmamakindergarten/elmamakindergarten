# Drilling a well for ElMaMa

We have recently expanded the water supply for the kindergarten and the neighbouring communities. In addition to the rain tanks at the school building, the Al-hadaad company has supported us with drilling a well to get water from underground during the dry seasons.

After 4 days of work on site, the team completed the drilling works and installed a robust hand-driven pump to raise water from underground.

The well can serve the kindergarten as well as the neighbouring families, which often come to the kindergarten grounds to get water from the tanks. The supply is now less dependent on rainfall and also available during the dry seasons.
